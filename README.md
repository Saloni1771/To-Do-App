# 📝 Todo App

A simple and elegant Todo List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to add tasks with due dates, view them in a structured layout, and delete them when completed. Tasks are stored in the browser's **localStorage**, so your list persists even after refreshing the page.

## 🚀 Features

- Add tasks with a due date
- Delete tasks when completed
- Input validation with error messages
- Responsive grid layout
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`
- Background images for a visually appealing interface
